# Typespess standalone server

This is a standalone version of Civ13's Typespess server. It bundles all the dependencies so you do not need to install anything (not even Node.JS or git!).

The first time you run the app, it will automatically download the latest version of the server from the git, and also update all the dependencies.

You can use the `updater.exe` app to update the code to the latest version automatically.
